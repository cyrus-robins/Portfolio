# Portfolio
This is a collection of my personal projects.

Project 1: Search Engine
  This project is a rudimentary search engine I created. It crawls the web and compiles a large-scale index of all of the text found on the crawled-through websites. It then efficiently traverses the created index and returns all relevant results to a given query.
  
  Project 2: Animal Colony Management Website (Frontend and Backend)
    This project is a website I created to help medical researchers keep track of their animal colonies. This react-based website interfaces with a firebase databse on the backend, where data and photos are stored.
